<h1 class="heading">CHICKEN POTPIE</h1>
<h3 class="content">1.Preheat oven to 425째. Place potatoes and carrots in a large saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, covered, 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain.<br>
2.In a large skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Stir in flour and seasonings until blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in chicken, peas, corn and potato mixture; remove from heat.<br>
3.Unroll a pie crust into each of two 9-in. pie plates; trim even with rims. Add chicken mixture. Unroll remaining crusts; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in tops.<br>
4.Bake 35-40 minutes or until crust is lightly browned. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.<br>
5.Freeze option: Cover and freeze unbaked pies. To use, remove from freezer 30 minutes before baking (do not thaw). Preheat oven to 425째. Place pies on baking sheets; cover edges loosely with foil. Bake 30 minutes. Reduce oven setting to 350째; bake 70-80 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and a thermometer inserted in center reads 165째.</h3>
